Captionr
===================

Captionr crowd sources captions for YouTube videos and synchronizes them using [CMU Sphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/). 

Captionr allows those who want to help deaf and hard of hearing people watch/listen to youtube videos volunteer their time and hearing without any effort on the part of the uploader or knowledge of how to time synchronize captions (often the hardest part in making captions).
